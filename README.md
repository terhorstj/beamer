# A beamer template for LaTeX 

* This template is primarily used for lecture slides. 

* Document formatting options are found in options.tex. 

* Images and figures can be placed in the figures/ subfolder. A sample logo is provided. 

* Iâ€™m using Helvetica as my font via helvet and the sfmath package. Greek and in-line math are provided by textgreek and sansmathfonts. 

* Macros obox and tbox can be used to place colored semi-transparent boxes or text boxes arbitrarily on the slide (see usage in options.tex). Macro qref is something I use to quickly format my footnote references.
